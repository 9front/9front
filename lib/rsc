This has always annoyed me.
If you tell me what the code should be I'll fix it.
I don't really understand what the problem is.
It was a failure of vision.
My apologies.
If you want to build your own, you've got all the pieces. :)
It's your call.
enjoy.
Yes, with a caveat.
No.
What were you doing when it crashed?
IBM wasn't thinking much about the future when they set up the VGA registers.
Thanks for the fix.
vga is a very hard problem.
I don't agree about the x86.
Hmm.  Not exactly what I had in mind.
We haven't been making the common distinction between stable and "unstable" versions of the software.
Put things in the right place to begin with.
in my mind wheel mice don't count.
i've been hoarding real three-button mice for a while now; the end is near.
I wrote a simple client long ago that I could dig up.
please, do us all a favor and write a better one.
i've tried mothra and charon, and neither satisfies me.
That's fine for now.
Have fun.
eww.
This is getting more off topic by the day.
It is possible to write very clear code that really doesn't need comments nor "literate" interpretation.
it looks like an error from hotmail, not from plan 9.
we're stuck with ssh, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking it's a good protocol.
Aha.
I might not understand the question.
Sorry about not being more specific.
Actually that's the way it's supposed to work.
that was me.
if you're going to do something about it, great.
I think.
Some extra work is required.
