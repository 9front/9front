.SH DESCRIPTION
The USB-SD-Mux from Linux Automation GmbH is a device
that can programmatically attach and detach a sd-card
from a device-under-test (DUT), allowing it to be 
re-written from another machine (HOST) without the
need to physically swap the sd-card.
.PP
The
.I mode
can be one of the following:
.TP
off
The sd-card is disconnected from both the HOST and the DUT.
.TP
dut
The sd-card is connected to the DUT and disconnected from
the HOST.
.TP
host
The sd-card is connected to the HOST and disconnected from
the DUT.
.PP
This program uses a vendor-specific SCSI command to change
the mode.
When not specified, it opens
.B /dev/sdUdca10/raw
which is the first USB-SD-Mux device attached to the HOST.
