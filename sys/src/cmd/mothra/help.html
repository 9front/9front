<H1>Mothra Help</H1>
<p>
Mothra is a World-wide Web browser. Its display looks like this:
<p><img src="file:display.pic" alt="[mothra display]">
<p>The display's regions, from top to bottom, are:
<ul>
<li>Error messages and other information.
<li>A text input window in which <a href="#commands">commands</a> can be typed.
<li>A scrollable list of titles of previously visited documents, with the most recent first.
Pointing at one of these lines with mouse button 1 revisits the document.
<li>The title of the currently-displayed document.
<li>The URL of the currently-displayed document.
<li>The scrollable document display.  Underlined text and
images surrounded by boxes may be pointed at with button 1 to
visit the files that they refer to.  Files that are not
HTML documents (for example images or mailto: urls) cause
<i>9v</i> or <i>mail</i> to pop up in a new 8&#189; window.
</ul>
<h4>Mouse Action</H4>
<p>Pointing with button
2 instead of button 1 selects a url without following it;
the url will be displayed in the selection: area and commands
will refer to the url, but it will not be drawn in the document display.
Button 3 pops up a command menu that contains
<ul>
<li><b>alt display</b><br>switches to (or from) the alternate display, which shows only
the scrollable document display area.  This might be useful when running mothra
in a small window.
<li><b>snarf url</b><br>copies the selected url into the snarf buffer.
<li><b>paste</b><br>appends the snarf buffer to the command window.
<li><b>inline pix</b><br>turn off/on loading of inline images.  Image maps cannot be disabled.
<li><b>fix cmap</b><br>reload the default plan 9 colormap
<li><b>save hit</b><br>appends the selected url to file:$home/lib/hit.html
<li><b>hit list</b><br>displays file:$home/lib/hit.html
<li><b>exit</b>
</ul>
<a name="#commands"><h4>Commands</h4></a>
<p>The commands you can type are:
<ul>
<li>g [url]<br>get the page with the given url (default, the selection.)
<li>r [url]<br>refresh the display if the URL changes.
Otherwise, you will probably see a cached version.
<li>s file<br>save the current page in the given file.
<li>w file<br>write a bitmap image of the document display area in the given file.
<li>q<br>exit.
<li>?<br>get help.
<li>h<br>get help.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
Mothra gets configuration information from the environment.
<ul>
<li>$url<br>The default <i>url</i> displayed when mothra starts.
A <i>url</i> given on the command line overrides this.
The default is <b>/sys/lib/mothra/start.html</b>
<li>$httpproxy<br>The network address of an http proxy server,
in the format expected by dial(2).  If $httpproxy is not set
or is null, no proxy server is used.
</ul>
<h4>Command line</h4>
If the mothra command has an argument, it is the name of a <i>url</i> to visit
instead of the startup page.  Giving mothra the <b>-i</b> flag disables loading
of inline images.  The <b>inline pix</b> menu item will reset this option.
<h4>Files</h4>
Mothra creates several files in $home/lib/mothra.
<ul>
<li>mothra.log<br>a list of all the url's visited
<li>mothra.err<br>a log of error messages, mostly uninteresting
<li>hit.html<br>the hit list used by the <b>save hit</b>
and <b>hit list</b> commands.  Since <b>save hit</b> only
adds new urls to the end of this file, it is safe to edit it
to add annotation or sort the saved urls.
</ul>
