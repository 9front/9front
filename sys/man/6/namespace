.TH NAMESPACE 6
.SH NAME
namespace \- name space description file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Namespace files describe how to construct a name space from scratch,
an operation normally performed by the
.I newns
or
.I addns
subroutines
(see
.IR auth (2))
which is typically called by
.IR init (8).
Each line specifies one name space operation.
Spaces and tabs separate arguments to operations;
no quotes or escapes are recognized.
Blank lines and lines with
.B #
as the first non-space character are ignored.
Environment variables of the form
.BI $ name
are expanded within arguments,
where
.I name
is a
.SM UTF
string terminated by white space, a
.BR / ,
or a
.BR $ .
.PP
The known operations and their arguments are:
.TF 0
.TP
.BR mount \ [ -abcC ]\ \fIservename\  old " \fR[\fIspec\fR\^\^]

.I servename
on

.BR unmount \ [ \fInew\fR ]\ \fIold
