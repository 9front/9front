.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mines
is an implementation of the game Minesweeper.
The game is played on a rectangular grid.
A certain number of mines is hidden beneath some of the tiles.
Left clicking on a tile uncovers it.
If a mine is revealed, the player loses.
Otherwise, a number is shown that indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent tiles.
The player wins once they have uncovered all tiles free from mines.
.PP
Right clicking marks a square, cycling through the flag marker indicating a mine and the query marker with no specific meaning (provided solely for the player's convenience).
Middle clicking will uncover all adjacent squares, if it is safe to do so (assuming the flag markers are set correctly).
.PP
The number at the top left indicates the number of mines remaining that are not marked by flags.
The number in the top right indicates the number of seconds elapsed.
The smiley face can be clicked to restart the game.
