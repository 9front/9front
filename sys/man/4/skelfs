.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Skelfs
generates directory skeletons
to assist in building namespaces.
Skeletons are generated on demand
by walking through the root directory.
A skeleon is a directory containing a single empty child.
The name of this child is defined by the first walk taken
away from the root. For example the hierarchy for a skeleton
named 'echo' would be:
.PP
.EX
	/
	/echo/
	/echo/echo
.EE
.PP
The
.I mode
dictates what form the innermost child file takes. The
.B file
and
.B dir
modes cause the child to be an empty file or directory
respecively. The
.B empty
mode instead serves no skeletons, causing the root
directory to always be empty.
A client may override the mode by providing
its own selection as an attach option. If a
mode is not provided,
.B file
is assumed.
.PP
The skeletons generated by
.I skelfs
are anonmyous. Clients will never see the
skeletons of other clients, nor can a client revisit
a previous skeleton.
