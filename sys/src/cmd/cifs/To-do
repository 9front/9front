more complete (server crossing) DFS support,
	This requires major changes. cifs should support multiple sessions
	via attach specifiers. Much of the existing code should be library-ised
	and a new app which sits above cifs used to resolve DFS referrals and
	launch new cifs sessions as required.

fix MAC signing
	should work but doesn't

also put modified mschap interface into factotum 
	This should give support for ntlmv2 auth  and mac signing

Support for FindNotify() callbacks rather than 1 second timer for directory caching

multithread the cifs
	most of the work is done, but some global state
	sitll exists and will need to be locked.

sort out why can I not make multiple connections from the same server?
	I already use a random number for the MUID already

RPC protocol support
	this will give file owner/group and ACLs/permissioms.

DFS lookups should occur on every use not just on walks,
	this should allow timeout and refresh of DFS referals.

ping RTT measurment cache timeout

seperate the virtual filesystems presented by attach specifier
	print - print queue
	state - status files, like Users and Sessions.
	main - normal filesystem
