.TH OEXPORTFS 4
.SH NAME
oexportfs \- legacy exportfs for cpu and import
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B oexportfs
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Oexportfs
is older version of the
.IR exportfs (4)
program that handles an initial protocol to establish a root directory
for the exported name space.
It also provides authentication and encryption using
the
.IR ssl (3)
device.
.PP
It is used exclusively by the deprecated
.IR cpu (1)
and
.IR import (4)
services.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B -d -f \fIdbgfile
Log all 9P traffic to
.I dbgfile
(default
.BR /tmp/exportdb ).
.TP
.B -P \fIpatternfile
Restrict the set of exported files.
.I Patternfile
contains one regular expression per line,
to be matched against path names
relative to the current working directory
and starting with
.BR / .
For a file to be exported, all lines with a prefix
.B +
must match and all those with prefix
.B -
must not match.
.TP
.B -R
Make the served name space read only.
.TP
.B -r \fIroot
Serve the name space rooted at
.IR root .
.TP
.B -S \fIservice
Serve the result of mounting
.IR service .
A separate mount is used for each
.IR attach (5)
message,
to correctly handle servers in which each mount
corresponds to a different client
.IR e.g. , (
.IR rio (4)).
.TP
.B -s
equivalent to
.B -r
.BR / ;
kept for compatibility.
.TP
.B -m \fImsize
Set the maximum message size that 
.I oexportfs
should offer to send (see
.IR version (5));
this helps tunneled
9P connections to avoid unnecessary fragmentation.
.TP
.B -A \fIaddress
Use the network
.I address
to announce
.IR aan (8)
connections,
if requested by the initial protocol.
.TP
.B -a
Authenticate the user with the
.I p9any
protocol before running the regular
.I oexportfs
session; used when 
.I oexportfs
is invoked to handle an incoming network connection.
.I Exportfs
creates a new name space for each connection, using
.B /lib/namespace
by default (see
.IR namespace (6)).
.TP
.B -B \fIaddress
Dial
.IR address ,
authenticate as a
.I p9any
client, and then
serve that network connection.
Requires setting the root of the name space with 
.B -r
or
.BR -s .
The remote system should run
.B import
.B -B
to handle the call.
See
.IR import (4)
for an example.
.TP
.B -e '\fIenc auth\fL'
Set the encryption and authentication algorithms to use for
encrypting the wire traffic (see
.IR ssl (3)).
The defaults are
.B rc4_256
and
.BR sha1 .
.TP
.B -N \fInsfile
Serve the name space described by
.IR nsfile .
.TP
.B -n
Disallow mounts by user
.BR none .
