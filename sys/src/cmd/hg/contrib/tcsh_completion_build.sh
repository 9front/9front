# Description
# -----------
# This script generates a tcsh source file to support completion
# of Mercurial commands and options.
#
# Instruction:
# -----------
# Run this script to generate the tcsh source file, and source
# the file to add command completion support for Mercurial.
#
#    tcsh% tcsh_completion.sh FILE
#    tcsh% source FILE
#
# If FILE is not specified, tcsh_completion will be generated.
#
# Bugs:
# ----
# 1. command specific options are not supported
# 2. hg commands must be specified immediately after 'hg'.
