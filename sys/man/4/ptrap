.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ptrap
.I port
[\fB!\fR]\fIregexp\fR
[ +\fIattr\fR [\fB!\fR]\fIregexp\fR ... ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ptrap
is a program that mounts itself over a
.IR plumber (4)
service mounted at
.B /mnt/plumb
and filters incoming messages according to the rules provided on the command line.
.PP
.I Ptrap
accepts an arbitrary number of filters;
each filter applies to a port, and may match over both the data and attributes of plumb messages.
.PP
A filter is formatted as a port name, a data filter, and a list of attribute filters.
.PP
The data filter is a
.IR regex (6)
that matches the plumbed data.
The attribute filter consists of the attribute name prefixed with a '+', followed by a
.IR regex (6)
that matches the contents of the attribute.
Any regex may be prefixed with a '!' in order to negate a match,
causing all matches for that regex to be discarded.
All parts of a filter must match in order for a plumb message to be forwarded.
.SH EXAMPLES
Start a 
.IR sam (1)
instance dedicated to editing kernel source code:
.IP
.EX
ptrap edit '^/sys/src/9/'
sam
.EE
.PP
In another window, start a second
.IR sam (1)
instance for all other editing jobs:
.IP
.EX
ptrap edit '!^/sys/src/9/'
sam
.EE
.PP
Start an
.IR acme (1)
instance instance dedicated to reading plumbed manual pages:
.IP
.EX
ptrap edit '.*' +action '^showdata' +filename '^/man/'
acme -c1
.EE
.SH SOURCE
.B /sys/src/cmd/ptrap.c

.SH BUGS
Multiple filters specified on the same port ignore all but the last one.
.PP
.I Ptrap
would be more useful if it could inhibit sending the message to other clients.
.PP
As far as
.IR plumber (4)
is concerned, even messages dropped by
.I ptrap
are "accepted", which means rules that are supposed to apply to messages not accepted by clients are not invoked (e.g. a rule starting an editor if no one is listening to the
.I edit
port will not work if there is a
.I ptrap
on that port).
.SH HISTORY
.I Ptrap
first appeared in 9front (February, 2018).
