.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Zuke
is a graphical music player that reads a playlist from standard input
and presents an interface to play music.
.PP
Playlists are generated by
.IR mkplist ,
which accepts files, directories, and URLs as its arguments,
and writes the resulting playlist to standard output. Option
.B -s
enables "simple" sorting of the entries of the playlist, where only
full paths are compared.
.PP
Formats supported by
.I zuke
are: MP3, OGG/Vorbis, FLAC, and WAV.  With additional programs, Opus,
modules and M4A (AAC) can be played.
.I Zuke
also supports network streams, such as IceCast.
Option
.B -s
enables ``shuffle'' mode on start.

The columns (and their order) displayed can be changed by passing the
following letters along

.PP
.I Zuke
can be controlled with a mouse, keyboard, and plumber.  Button 1
selects a track, button 2 plays a track.  Clicking on the seek bar
changes the playback position accordingly.  On the right of the seek
bar, current position, track duration and volume are displayed.  ``∫''
is shown if shuffle mode is enabled.

Plumbing a file with
.B .plist
extension loads the playlist in
.IR zuke .
This is useful with a collection of playlists displayed aside.

.PP
Typing any digit initiates a "Seek to" prompt. Minutes, hours and
seconds can be separated with a colon, if needed, otherwise the
position is taken as seconds from the beginning of the track.
.PP
.I Zuke
can be controlled by emulating key presses via the plumber port
.IR audio .
.PP
Files present in the current playlist can be plumbed too, and will be
played immediately.
.PP
When a new track starts playing,
.I zuke
will write its tags to
.BR stdout ,
each column separated by a tab character.  If playback is stopped, an
empty line is written instead.  This can be used for scrobbling or
displaying the current track in another window.
