This has always annoyed me.
If you tell me what the code should be I'll fix it.
I don't really understand what the problem is.
It was a failure of vision.
My apologies.
If you want to build your own, you've got all the pieces. :)
It's your call.
enjoy.
Yes, with a caveat.
No.
What were you doing when it crashed?
IBM wasn't thinking much about the future when they set up the VGA registers.
Thanks for the fix.
vga is a very hard problem.
I don't agree about the x86.
Hmm.  Not exactly what I had in mind.
We haven't been making the common distinction between stable and "unstable" versions of the software.
Put things in the right place to begin with.
in my mind wheel mice don't count.
i've been hoarding real three-button mice for a while now; the end is near.
I wrote a simple client long ago that I could dig up.
please, do us all a favor and write a better one.
i've tried mothra and charon, and neither satisfies me.
That's fine for now.
Have fun.
eww.
This is getting more off topic by the day.
It is possible to write very clear code that really doesn't need comments nor "literate" interpretation.
it looks like an error from hotmail, not from plan 9.
we're stuck with ssh, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking it's a good protocol.
Aha.
I might not understand the question.
Sorry about not being more specific.
Actually that's the way it's supposed to work.
that was me.
if you're going to do something about it, great.
I think.
Some extra work is required.
that's a bigger job than you might think.
We can fix the code, probably.
This is misleading.
it took me just as long to install the windows software as it did to write the plan 9 software.
All things being equal, maybe I'd like there to be more Plan 9 users.
Sorry, I don't think there's much we can do.
The bikeshed has already been painted, and the painter has gone.
Being stuck using Solaris makes being stuck using Linux look like a birthday party.
also, plan9front claims to include a working go compiler. what did they do?
I don't think we'd scale to a thousand nodes very well.
Buh?
Feature lists are great, but don't forget that there's always an implementation cost.
Sorry, no luck.
Now, now, be fair.
I wish...
We tried that.
Dude, wake up!
Looks like a bug to me.
You think Windows runs in polynomial time?
Also, backups are good.
if you want something in particular, you could always port it.
Suppose you subscribe to the Kernighan & Plauger thesis that programs should be clear.
NOT LGTM
Even if we'd made a horrible mistake, though, we cannot change it now as that would break the compatibility promise we have made with Go 1.
Your source is mistaken.
This sounds like an intriguing and fun way to structure a program.
Chording works too: or example, copy is hold down mouse button, highlight, type option, type command, let go of mouse button.
Very nice.
looks fine.
Thanks, but I'd prefer not to do this.
Interesting, thanks.
Ouch
Please don't.
Test?
sure
NOT LGTM sorry
i lost the ability to use rio a few years ago when they moved wireless configuration into the gnome window manager, making it impossible to have rio and a network connection at the same time.
I think we all just use Chrome or Firefox or whatever.
I think we're done here.
I think you have to drag it into the Applications folder.
I ran Plan 9 from Bell Labs as my day to day work environment until around 2002.
Let's focus on what's there.
If the Plan 9 group had had its way, Plan 9 would have been released for free under a trivial MIT-like license (the one used for other pieces of code, like the one true awk) in 2003 instead of creating the Lucent Public License. Or in 2000 instead of creating the "Plan 9 License". Or in 1995 instead of as a $350 book+CD that came with a license for use by an entire "organization". Or in 1992 instead of being a limited academic release.
Code freeze on March 1 does not mean "break everything the day before March 1".
Godoc is a relatively small program. It is built from 102 packages built from 582 source files.
does anyone understand why the dragonfly builder times out connecting to localhost during run.bash?
We've entered the feature freeze.
We're far from stable right now.
it would be nice to be able to try the plan 9 go port without a plan 9 system.
is anyone willing to put together a plan 9 qemu image with mercurial set up and a go tree checked out and ready to build?
okay.
sounds worth trying
I'd like to keep the discussion here about Windows 2000 support in general and not about the technical details of this specific problem.
But that is just a guess.
RFC 3339 is very clear about this.
Thanks.
It is just not worth the effort.
Hello there.  Has anyone written a vt100 emulator for Plan9?  Thanks.
Much better to spend time reading and learning from the code than blogging about what's wrong with the local variable names.
I would prefer to arrange that the output is useful.
Nice.
No one googles local variable names.
This is not a step forward.
the opposite of brevity is length, not clarity.
