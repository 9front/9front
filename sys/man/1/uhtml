.TH UHTML 1
.SH NAME
uhtml \- convert foreign character set HTML file to unicode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uhtml
[
.B -p
] [
.B -c
.I charset
] [
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
HTML comes in various character-set encodings
and has special forms to encode characters. To
make it easier to process HTML, uhtml is used
to normalize it to a Unicode-only form.
.LP
Uhtml detects the character set of the HTML input
.I file
and calls
.IR tcs (1)
to convert it to UTF replacing HTML-entity forms
by their Unicode character representations except for 
.BR lt ,
.BR gt ,
.BR amp ,
.BR quot ,
and
.BR apos .
The converted HTML is written to
standard output. If no
.I file
was given, it is read from standard input. If the
.B -p
option is given, the detected character set is printed and
the program exits without conversion.
In case character-set detection fails, the default (UTF)
is assumed. This default can be changed with the
.B -c
option.
