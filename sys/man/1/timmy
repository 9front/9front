.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Timmy
is a simple 2D physics sandbox.
.PP
To pick up an object click on it with mouse button 1.
New objects can be created by picking up their archetypes in the gray area on the bottom (the "tray").
To place an object in the working area click at the desired position with mouse button 1;
.I timmy
will refuse to place the object if it would collide with an existing one.
To abort the process \(em deleting the carried object \(em click anywhere with mouse button 3.
Picking up an object in the working area with mouse button 3 will duplicate the object.
.PP
The following operations can be performed with the keyboard.
.IP w
Rotate carried object by 15° to the left.
.IP e
Rotate carried object by 15° to the right.
.IP space
Start or stop the simulation.
.IP del
Exit timmy.
.PP
The small circles on some objects are "hinges".
Two hinges can be connected by placing them on top of each other.
Their relative position will not change during the simulation; objects are however free to rotate around them.
To undo a hinge, pick up either of the objects.
.PP
The
.B -s
option adjusts the speed of the simulation; only integer values are permitted.
It does not compromise accuracy.
