.SH DESCRIPTION
Mercurial is a distributed version control system. It tracks
and organizes files and keeps a change history of them. The
file revisions are stored as packed deltas in a repository
and can be checked out with the
.IR hg (1)
program.

Hgfs allows read only access to all stored file revisions
in a repository as simple files.

Starting hgfs without any options finds the repository of
the current working directory and mounts itself to
.B /n/hg.

The served directory contains a list of subdirectories
each corresponding to a specific changeset revision.

The special
name
.B tip
corresponds to the latest changeset but is not listed.

In each revision directory the following files can be found:
.TP
.B rev1,rev2
These files contain the two parent revision ids as text.
.TP
.B log
The
.B log
file contains a list of file names, separated by newline, that where
touched in this changeset. Files that are listed in the log
but are not visible in
.B files or
.B changes
where deleted in this changeset.
.TP
.B who,why
These files contains the commiter and the commit message of
the changeset.
.TP
.B files,changes
These directories contain a snapshot of the filetree when this
change was made. The 
.B changes
directory contains only the changed
files.

On files in the
.B files
and
.B changes
directories, one can append
.I .n
(or
.I .revn
to get the revision id)
to the filename where
.I n
is the nth past version of the file.
