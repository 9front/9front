all right all right all right!
so much for good intentions.
not quite...
It's easy to make serious mistakes in that situation.
I agree with some of the others here that the solution probably lies in external contributions from wise members of the community.
It's still a race.
Ditto.
A program exits when main exits.
That's just an error I will fix.
You could just drop the adjective.
I recommend that you fix your code now and be ready for the next release.
No.
I accept the argument about regularity but not the one about utility.
Every acme user around here uses the plan9port version.
There is no general solution but we are aware of the desire.
I'm not sure how that helps.
It's clumsy, I know, although it could be (and will one day be) done a little better.
I don't know what that means.
But what are you really trying to do?
I thought of a few ways but I refuse to write them down for fear people will use them.
It may be that another approach altogether is better.
Your assurances are incorrect.
When I look at your code I see a lot of unnecessary repetition.
Exactly.
Yes.
Poor choice. You went wrong at step 1.
Interesting idea, though.
if crypticness is the complaint, remember you're talking about a C compiler.
Thought I'd post this to a DOOM group.
There are no plans for a new release of Plan 9.
