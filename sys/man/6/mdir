.SH NAME
mdir \- mail directory format
.SH SYNOPSIS
The
.I mdir
format is used by Upas as a replacement
for tradition mailbox format.  An
.I mdir
mailbox is a directory containing any
number of messages stored one message
per file.  Individual messages are stored
in the same format they would be in a
traditional mailbox; each message is a
valid mailbox with a single message.
The message files are named with the
UNIX seconds corresponding to the date
on the
.LR From 
line, a “.” separator and a two digit
sequence starting with
.LR 00 .
.PP
One
.I mdir
may contain other
.I mdirs
but (currently) this relationship is in name only.
The mail box
.B /mail/box/\f2a\f5
does not contain any messages from
.BR /mail/box/\f2a\f5/\f2b\f5 ,
according to
.IR upasfs (4).
