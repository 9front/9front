.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Page
is a general purpose document viewer.
It can be used to display the individual pages
of a
PostScript,
PDF,
or 
.IR troff (1)
device independent output
file.
.I Troff
output is simply converted to PostScript in order to be viewed.
It can also be used to view any number of
graphics files
(such as a 
FAX
page, 
a Plan 9
.IR image (6)
file, an Inferno bitmap file, or other common format).
.I Page
displays these
in sequence.
In the absence of named files,
.I page
reads one from standard input.
.PP
By default,
.I page
runs in the window in which it is started
and leaves the window unchanged.
The 
.B -R
option causes 
.I page 
to grow the window if necessary
to display the page being viewed.
The
.B -w
option causes 
.I page 
to create a new window for itself.
The newly created window will grow as under the
.B -R
option.
.PP
The 
.B -p 
option sets the resolution for PostScript and PDF
files, in pixels per inch.
The default is 100 ppi.
.PP
When viewing images with 
.IR page ,
it listens to the 
.B image
plumbing channel
(see 
.IR plumber (4))
for more images to display.
The 
.B -i
option causes 
.I page
to not load any graphics files nor to read 
from standard input but rather to listen
for ones to load from the plumbing channel.
.PP
The
.B -j
option with a page address
.I addr
jumps to the specified page on startup.
.PP
Pressing and holding button 1 permits panning about the page.
.PP
Button 2 raises a menu of operations on the current image or the
entire set.  The image transformations are non-destructive and are
valid only for the currently displayed image.  They are lost as soon
as another image is displayed.

Plan 9 bitmap.
.TP
.B Ext

to be selected for viewing in any order.

.PP
To go to a specific page, one can type its number followed by enter.
Typing left arrow or backspace displays the previous page.
Typing right arrow, space, or enter displays the next page.
The up and down arrow pan up and down one half screen height,
changing pages when panning off the top or bottom of the page.
.PP
.I Page
calls
.IR gs (1)
to draw each page of PostScript
and
PDF
.IR files .
It also calls a variety of conversion programs, such as those described in
.IR jpg (1),
to convert the various raster graphics formats
into Inferno bitmap files.
Pages are converted ``on the fly,'' as needed.
