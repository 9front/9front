\chapter{Interprocess Communication and Networking}
\label{ipc}

The modules described in this chapter provide mechanisms for different
processes to communicate.

Some modules only work for two processes that are on the same machine,
e.g.  \module{signal} and \module{subprocess}.  Other modules support
networking protocols that two or more processes can used to
communicate across machines.

The list of modules described in this chapter is:
