.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Webfs
presents a file system interface to the parsing and retrieving
of URLs.
.I Webfs
mounts itself at
.I mtpt
(default
.BR /mnt/web ),
and, if 
.I service
is specified, will post a service file descriptor in 
.BR /srv/\fIservice .
.PP
If the environment variable
.B httpproxy
is set, all HTTP request initiated by
.I webfs
will be made through that proxy url.
.PP
.I Webfs
presents a three-level file system suggestive
of the network protocol hierarchies
.IR ip (3)
and
.IR ether (3).
.PP
The top level contains the two files:
.BR ctl ,
and
.BR clone .
.PP
The top level
.B ctl
file is used to maintain parameters global to the instance of
.IR webfs .
Reading the 
.B ctl
file yields the current values of the parameters.
Writing strings of the form
.RB `` attr " " value ''
sets a particular attribute.
.PP
The following global parameters can be set:
.TP
.B useragent
Sets the HTTP user agent string.
.TP
.B timeout
Sets the request timeout in milliseconds.
.TP
.BI flushauth " url"
Flushes any associated authentication information for
resources under
.I url
or all resources if no url was given.
.TP
.BI preauth " url realm"
Preauthenticates all resources under
.I url
with the given
.I realm
using HTTP Basic authentication. This will cause
.I webfs
to preemptively send the resulting authorization information
not waiting for the server to respond with an
HTTP 401 Unauthorized status.
.PP
The top-level directory also contains
numbered directories corresponding to connections, which
may be used to fetch a single URL.
To allocate a connection, open the
.B clone
file and read a number 
.I n
from it.
After opening, the
.B clone
file is equivalent to the file
.IB n /ctl \fR.
A connection is assumed closed once all files in its
directory have been closed, and is then will be reallocated.
.PP
Each connection has a URL attribute
.B url
associated with it.
This URL may be an absolute URL such as
.I http://www.lucent.com/index.html
or a relative URL such as
.IR ../index.html .
The
.B baseurl
attribute sets the URL against which relative URLs
are interpreted.
Once the URL has been set by writing to the
.B ctl
file of the connection, its pieces can be retrieved via
individual files in the
.B parsed
directory:
.de UU
.TP
.B parsed/\fI\\$1
\\$2
..
.UU url http://pete:secret@www.example.com:8000/cgi/search?q=kittens#results
.UU scheme http
.UU user pete
.UU pass secret
.UU host www.example.com
.UU port 8000
.UU path /cgi/search
.UU query q=kittens
.UU fragment results
.PP
If there is associated data to be posted with the request,
it can be written to
.BR postbody .
Opening
.B postbody
or
.B body
initiates the request. If the request fails,
then opening the
.B body
or writing to
.B postbody
file will fail and return a error string.
.PP
When the
.B body
file has been opened, response headers appear
as files in the connection directory. For example
reading the
.B contenttype
file yields the MIME content type of the body data.
If the request was redirected, the URL represented
by the
.B parsed
directory will change to the final destination.
.PP
The resulting data may be read from
.B body
as it arrives.
.PP
The following is a list of attributes that can be
set to do a connection prior initiating the request:
.TP
.B url,baseurl
See above.
.TP
.B useragent
Sets a custom useragent string to be used with the request.
.TP
.B contenttype
Sets the MIME content type of the postbody.
.TP
.B request
Usually, the HTTP method used is
.B POST
when
.B postbody
file is opend first or
.B GET
otherwise. This can be overridden with the
.B request
attribute so send arbitrary HTTP requests.
.TP
.B headers
Adds arbitrary HTTP headers to be send with
the request.
.SH EXAMPLE
.B /rc/bin/hget
is a simple client.
.SH SOURCE
.B /sys/src/cmd/webfs
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR webcookies (4),
.IR hget (1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
For cookies to work,
.IR webcookies (4),
should be running and mounted on
.B /mnt/webcookies
otherwise cookies will be ignored.
.SH HISTORY
.I Webfs
first appeared in Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It was
rewritten from scratch for 9front (January, 2012).
