.I cmd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Atazz
is an interactive program for exercising
raw ATA devices.
Its intended purpose is to support odd and
administrative commands without requiring this
functionality be implemented by each device driver.
It reads commands from standard input and applies
them to an ATA target.  Communication is in SATA
FIS format.  Non-ATA devices accessed
through the
.IR sd (3)
interface will not work; ATAPI devices will respond
to the commands in the ACS-2 packet feature set.
If the
.B -c
option is given, the name of the given numeric ATA
command is printed.
.I sddev
is given on the command line, an
.B open
(see below)
is immediately applied to the target.
On completion of a command, any errors are
printed followed by the prompt
.LR "az> " .
The response FIS may be printed with the
command
.BR rfis .
Some commands like
.B "identify device"
print processed output by default.  Redirecting the
output to a file will give the raw output as will the
.B -r
flag.
In addition the following commands are implemented
internally
.TF "< > <> file"
.PD
.TP
.BI "< > <> " file
Redirect output, input or both to or from a file.
If
.I file
is missing, then the redirection is closed.
.TP
.B close
Close the currently open device.
.TP
.B dev
Print device path and basic information.
.TP
.BR issuetr " [ \fIcommand\fP ... ]"
Toggle command issue tracing.  With no arguments,
issuetr toggles tracing for all commands.  Commands
may be specified by number.
.TP
.BI open " dev
Open the named device.
.TP
.B probe
Print a list of available device paths, size, sector size
and WWNs.  The first column is a suitable argument
for
.BR open .
.TP
.B rfis
Print the returned FIS, if any.
.PP
For all commands, it is possible to manipulate
the sata registers directly by specifying the register
name and an 8-bit value.  The registers are

In addition, commands that take an LBA and a number of
sectors may be given those arguments directly, for example
to read 1 sector starting at lba 100,
.EX
.IP
az> read dma ext 100 1

Subcommands are spelled out as in ACS-2.
For example, to set the transfer mode to UDMA 6, enable
the write cache and to enable and report smart status, one would
.EX
.IP
az> set features set transfer mode udma 6
az> set features enable write cache
az> smart enable operations
az> smart return status
normal
.EE
.PP
SCT pseudo-protocol commands are also supported.
.EX
.IP
az> sct error recovery time set read timer = 5
az> sct error recovery time return read timer

.SH BUGS
Subcommand help doesn't work.  ACS-2 commands are
tortuously verbose.
