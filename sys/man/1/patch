.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Patch
scans its input for a sequence of patches, and applies them, printing the list of changed files.
When an applied patch does not match precisely,
.I patch
will scan the input file for matching context, applying the patch up to 250 lines away from
its original location.
If a hunk does not apply, then the file is left untouched.
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B -R
Reverse direction of the patch. Additions become removals,
and the new and old file names are swapped.
.TP
.B -n
Print the files that would be modified by this patch, but do not apply it.
.TP
.BI -p \ nstrip
Remove the prefix containing
.I nstrip
leading slashes from each file path in the diff file.

format:
