9 Front kernel for the MediaTek MT7688

currently tested on;
Onion Omega 2
Hi-Link HKL7688A



FPU Emulation;
The MIPS24KEc core used in the MT7688 does 
not have a FPU.  Because of the way Mips 
does branch delay slots, tos.h needs to 
include a scratch space for fpimips.c

	/* scratch space for kernel use (e.g., mips fp delay-slot execution) */
	ulong	kscr[4];
	/* top of stack is here */

Since lots of things use tos.h, the enitre 
spim environment needs to be nuked and reinstalled 
to keep things consistent.


Build Environment;
Because libc for spim ends up using a combination 
of portable code, and mips and spim machine specific 
code, I have seen some issues where things being 
built in the wrong order causes failure in the 
kernel.  For best results;

cd /sys/src
objtype=spim
mk nuke
mk libs
mk install


Drivers;
The first UART, often documented as 
"UART Lite" or "UARTL", is set up, but no others.

The MT7688 has 1 Ethernet device wired directly 
into a 7 port switch, usually on port 5.  Port 0 
is typically used as the WAN port on routers, and 
ports 1-4 are the LAN ports.  

Right now, the Ethernet driver, ether7688.c, just 
sets up the switch to run ports 1-5 as a simple 
unmanaged switch to allow outside connections.  
This has been tested on the HKL7688A, but not on 
the Onion Omega 2 with the Ethernet expansion.

WiFi, SPI, IÂ²C, GPIO, USB, MMC, and a dedicated 
switch driver are works in progress.


u-boot;
The kernel currently assumes that it will be 
loaded at 0x80020000 and that plan9.ini will 
be loaded at 0x80010000 (CONFADDR)


nvram;
In order to connect to your auth and fileserver, 
copy a nvram with the credentials you want into 
a file, and add the location of that file (ex. /usr/
glenda/nvram) to the bootdir section of the kernel 
configuration file (mt7688).

In plan9.ini, specify to use the nvram in the 
/boot directory in the kernel;
nvram=/boot/nvram
nvroff=0
nvrlen=512


Erratum 48;
There is a known issue with the 24K series cores, 
where data is lost if 3 cache writes are done in 
a row.  The mips linker in some legacy Plan 9 
distributions has a change in vl/noop.c where it 
can be set to insert a no-op between stores to 
avoid this issue.
