.TH PLAN9.INI 8
.SH NAME
plan9.ini \- configuration file for PCs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I none
.SH DESCRIPTION
When booting Plan 9 on a PC, the bootloader program
.IR 9boot (8)
first reads configuration information from a file
on the boot media.
This file,
.BR plan9.ini ,
looks like a shell script containing lines of the form
.IP
.EX
name=\f2value\fP
.EE
.LP
each of which defines a kernel or device parameter.
.PP
Blank lines and
Carriage Returns
.IB ( \er )
are ignored.
.B #
comments are ignored, but are only recognised if
.L #
appears at the start of a line.
.PP
For devices, the generic format of
.I value
is
.IP
.EX
type=TYPE [port=N] [irq=N] [mem=N] [size=N] [dma=N] [ea=N]
.EE
.LP
specifying the controller type,
the base I/O port of the interface, its interrupt
level, the physical starting address of any mapped memory,
the length in bytes of that memory, the DMA channel,
and for Ethernets an override of the physical network address.
Not all elements are relevant to all devices; the relevant values
and their defaults are defined below in the description of each device.
.PP
The file is used by the kernel to configure the hardware available.
The information it contains is also passed to the boot
process, and subsequently other programs,
as environment variables
(see
.IR boot (8)).
However, values whose names begin with an asterisk
.B *
are used by the kernel and are not converted into environment variables.
.PP
The following sections describe how variables are used.
.SS ETHERNET
.SS \fLether\fIX\fL=\fIvalue\fP
This defines an Ethernet interface.
.IR X ,
a unique monotonically increasing number beginning at 0,
identifies an Ethernet card to be probed at system boot.
Probing stops when a card is found or there is no line for
.BR etherX+1 .
After probing as directed by the
.BI ether X
lines, any remaining Ethernet cards that can be automatically
detected are added.
Almost all cards can be automatically detected.
For debugging purposes, automatic probing can
be disabled by specifying the line
.BR *noetherprobe= .
.PP
Some cards are software configurable and do not require all options.
Unspecified options default to the factory defaults.

.TP
.B wavelan
Lucent Wavelan (Orinoco) IEEE 802.11b
and compatible PCMCIA cards.
Compatible cards include the Dell TrueMobile 1150
and the Linksys Instant Wireless Network PC Card.
Port and IRQ defaults are 0x180 and 3 respectively.
.IP
These cards take a number of unique options to aid in
identifying the card correctly on the 802.11b network.
The network may be
.I "ad hoc"
or
.I managed
(i.e. use an access point):
.EX
	mode=[adhoc, managed]
.EE
and defaults to
.IR managed .
The 802.11b network to attach to
.RI ( managed
mode)
or identify as
.RI ( "ad hoc"
mode),
is specified by
.EX
	essid=string
.EE
and defaults to a null string.
The card station name is given by
.EX
	station=string
.EE
and defaults to
.IR "Plan 9 STA" .
The channel to use is given by
.EX
	channel=number
.EE
where
.I number
lies in the range 1 to 16 inclusive;
the channel is normally negotiated automatically.
.IP
If the card is capable of encryption,
the following options may be used:
.EX
	crypt=[off, on]
.EE
and defaults to
.IR on .
.EX
	key\fIN\fP=string
.EE
sets the encryption key
.I N
(where
.I N
is in the range 1 to 4 inclusive) to
.IR string ;
this will also set the transmit key to
.I N
(see below).
There are two formats for
.I string
which depend on the length of the string.
If it is exactly 5 or 13 characters long it is assumed
to be an alphanumeric key; if it is exactly 10 or 26 characters
long the key is assumed to be in hex format (without a leading
.IR 0x ).
The lengths are checked,
as is the format of a hex key.
.EX
	txkey=number
.EE
sets the transmit key to use to be
.I number
in the range 1 to 4 inclusive.
If it is desired to exclude or include unencrypted packets
.EX
	clear=[off, on]
.EE
configures reception and defaults to inclusion.
.IP
The defaults are intended to match the common case of
a managed network with encryption and a typical entry would
only require, for example
.EX
	essid=left-armpit key1=afish key2=calledraawaru
.EE
if the port and IRQ defaults are used.
These options may be set after boot by writing to the device's
.I ctl
file using a space as the separator between option and value, e.g.
.EX
	echo 'key2 1d8f65c9a52d83c8e4b43f94af' >/net/ether0/0/ctl
.EE
.IP
Card-specific power management may be enabled/disabled by
.EX
	pm=[on, off]
.EE

Intel Wireless WiFi Link mini PCI-Express adapters require
firmware from
.B http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/*/iwn-firmware*.tgz
to be present on attach in
.B /lib/firmware
or
.B /boot.
To limit the selected APs the options
.B essid=
and
.B bssid=
may be set at boot or in the ether interface clone file 
using a space as the separator between option and value, e.g.
.EX
	echo essid left-armpit >/net/ether1/clone
.EE
Scan results appear in the
.B ifstats
file and can be read out like:

.EE
option need be given.
.PP
NCR/Symbios/LSI-Logic 53c8xx-based adapters
and Mylex MultiMaster (Buslogic BT-*) adapters are
automatically detected and need no entries.
.PP
By default, the NCR 53c8xx driver searches for up to 32 controllers.
This can be changed by setting the variable
.BR *maxsd53c8xx .
.PP
By default the Mylex driver resets SCSI cards by using
both the hard reset and SCSI bus reset flags in the driver interface.
If a variable
.BR *noscsireset
is defined, the SCSI bus reset flag is omitted.
.SS \fLaoeif=\fP\fIlist\fP
This specifies a space-separated
.I list
of Ethernet interfaces to be bound at boot to the ATA-over-Ethernet driver,
.IR aoe (3).
For example,
.LR "aoeif=ether0 ether1" .
Only interfaces on this list will initially be accessible via AoE.
.SS \fLaoedev=e!#æ/aoe/\fIshelf\fL.\fIslot\fR
This specifies an ATA-over-Ethernet device accessible via the interfaces
named in
.IR aoeif
on AoE
.I shelf
and
.I slot
to use as a root device for bootstrapping.
.SS \fLramdisk\fIX\fL=\fIsize\fP
.SS \fLramdisk\fIX\fL=\fIsize sectorsize\fP
.SS \fLramdisk\fIX\fL=\fIaddress size sectorsize\fP
This reserves physical memory as a ramdisk that will appear as
.IR sd (3)
device \fLsdZ\fIX\fR.
When the
.I address
argument is omited or zero, then the ramdisk will be allocated
from the top of physical memory.
.SS AUDIO
.SS \fLaudio\fIX\fL=\fIvalue\fP
This defines a sound interface. PCI based audio devices such as
Intel HD audio or AC97 are autodetected and do not require any settings.

The DMA channel may be any of 5, 6, or 7.
The defaults are
.IP
.EX
port=0x220 irq=7 dma=5
.EE
.SS UARTS
Plan 9 automatically configures COM1 and COM2, if found,
as
.B eia0
(port 0x3F8, IRQ4)
and
.B eia1
(port 0x2F8, IRQ3)
respectively.
These devices can be disabled by adding a line:
.IP
.EX
eia\fIX\fP=disabled
.EE
.LP
This is typically done in order to reuse the IRQ for
another device.
.P 
.PP
Additional i8250 (ISA) uarts (uart2 to uart5) can be
configured using:
.IP
.EX
uart\fIX\fP=type=isa port=\fIport\fP irq=\fIirq
.EE
.PP
Perle PCI-Fast4, PCI-Fast8, and PCI-Fast16 controllers
are automatically detected and need no configuration lines.
.PP
The line
.B serial=type=com
can be used to specify settings for a PCMCIA modem.
.SS \fLmouseport=\fIvalue\fP
This specifies where the mouse is attached.
.I Value
can be
.TP
.B ps2
the PS2 mouse/keyboard port.  The BIOS setup procedure
should be used to configure the machine appropriately.
.TP
.B ps2intellimouse
an Intellimouse on the PS2 port.
.TP
.B 0
for COM1
.TP
.B 1
for COM2
.SS \fLmodemport=\fIvalue\fP
Picks the UART line to call out on.
This is used when connecting to a file server over
an async line.
.I Value
is the number of the port.
.SS \fLconsole=\fIvalue params\fP
This is used to specify the console device.
The default
.I value
is
.BR cga ;
a number
.B 0
or
.B 1
specifies
.I COM1
or
.I COM2
respectively.
A serial console is initially configured with the
.IR uart (3)
configuration string
.B b9600
.B l8
.B pn
.BR s1 ,
specifying 9600 baud,
8 bit bytes, no parity, and one stop bit.
If
.I params
is given, it will be used to further
configure the uart.
Notice that there is no
.B =
sign in the
.I params
syntax.
For example,
.IP
.EX
console=0 b19200 po
.EE
.LP
would use COM1 at 19,200 baud
with odd parity.
.LP
The value
.B net
specifies ``netconsole'' which sends console messages as UDP packets over the network.
It bypasses the IP stack and writes Ethernet packets directly to the NIC.
In this case
.I params
is mandatory and takes the form
.IP
\fIsrcip\fR [ \fB!\fIsrcport \fR] [ \fB/\fIdevno \fR] \fB, \fIdstip\fR [ \fB!\fIdstport \fR] [ \fB/\fIdstmac \fR]
.LP
\fISrcip\fR, \fIsrcport\fR (default 6665), \fIdstip\fR and \fIdstport\fR (default 6666) specify the source IP address, source port, destination IP address and destination port, respectively.
\fIDevno\fR (default 0) specifies which NIC to use, a value of \fIn\fR corresponds to NIC at \fL#l\fIn\fR (see
.IR ether (3)).
\fIDstmac\fR specifies the destination MAC address; broadcast packets are sent if it is unspecified.
Note that it is possible, but not recommended, to send packets to a host outside the local network by specifying the MAC address of the gateway as \fIdstmac\fR.
Example lines are
.IP
.EX
console=net 192.168.0.4,192.168.0.8
console=net 192.168.2.10!1337/1,192.168.2.3!1337/0ea7deadbeef
.EE
.LP
.SS "PC CARD"
.SS \fLpccard0=disabled\fP
Disable probing for and automatic configuration of PC card controllers.
.SS \fLpcmcia\fIX\fL=type=XXX irq=\fIvalue\fP
If the default IRQ for the
PCMCIA
is correct, this entry can be omitted.  The value of
.B type
is ignored.
.SS \fLpcmcia0=disabled\fP
Disable probing for and automatic configuration of PCMCIA controllers.
.SS BOOTING
.SS \fLbootfile=\fIvalue\fP
This is used to direct the actions of
.IR 9boot (8)
by naming the file from which to load the kernel in
the current BIOS boot device.
.SS \fLbootargs=\fIvalue\fP
The
.I value
of this variable is passed to
.IR boot (8)
by the kernel as the name of the root file system to
automatically mount and boot into.
It is typically used to specify additional arguments to
pass to
.IR cwfs (4)
or
.IR ipconfig (8).
For example, if the system is to run from a local
.IR cwfs (4)
partition, the definition might read
.BR bootargs=local!/dev/sdC0/fscache .
See
.IR boot (8)
for more.
.SS \fLnobootprompt=\fIvalue\fP
Suppress the
.L "root from"
prompt and use
.I value
as the answer instead.
.SS \fLuser=\fIvalue\fP
Suppress the
.L "user"
prompt and use
.I value
as the answer instead.
.SS \fLservice=\fIvalue\fP
Changes the systems default role. Possible
settings for
.I value
are
.B cpu
and
.B terminal.
.SS \fLdebugfactotum=\fP
Causes
.IR boot (8)
to start
.I factotum
with the
.B -p
option, so that it can be debugged.
.SS \fLcfs=\fIvalue\fP
This gives the name of the file holding the disk partition
for the cache file system,
.IR cfs (4).
Extending the
.B bootargs
example, one would write
.BR cfs=#S/sdC0/cache .
.SS \fLbootdisk=\fIvalue\fP
This deprecated variable was used to specify the disk used by
the cache file system and other disk-resident services.
It is superseded by
.B bootargs
and
.BR cfs .
.SS \fLfs=\fIaddress\fP
.SS \fLauth=\fIaddress\fP
.SS \fLsecstore=\fIaddress\fP
These specify the network address (IP or domain name)
of the file, authentication and secstore server
to use when mounting a network-provided root file system.
When not specified, then these settings are determined via DHCP.
When
.B secstore
is not specified, then the authentication server is used.
.SS PROCESSOR
.SS \fL*e820=\fItype \fB0x\fIstart \fB0x\fIend ...\fP
This variable is automatically generated by the boot loader (see
.IR 9boot (8))
by doing a BIOS E820 memory scan while still in realmode and
passed to the kernel. The format is a unordered list of 
decimal region
.I type
and hexadecimal 64-bit
.I start
and
.I end
addresses of the area.
.SS \fL*maxmem=\fIvalue\fP
This defines the maximum physical address that the system will scan when sizing memory.
By default the PC operating system will scan up to 3.75 gigabytes
(0xF0000000, the base of kernel virtual address space), but setting
.B *maxmem
will limit the scan.
.B *maxmem
must be less than 3.75 gigabytes.
This variable is not consulted if using the E820 memory map.
.SS \fL*kernelpercent=\fIvalue\fP
This defines what percentage of available memory is reserved for the kernel allocation pool.
The remainder is left for user processes.  The default
.I value
is
.B 30
on CPU servers,
.B 60
on terminals with less than 16MB of memory,
and
.B 40
on terminals with memories of 16MB or more.
Terminals use more kernel memory because
.IR draw (3)
maintains its graphic images in kernel memory.
This deprecated option is rarely necessary in newer kernels.
.SS \fL*imagemaxmb=\fIvalue\fP
This limits the maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) the graphics
image memory pool can grow. The default is unlimited for terminals
and cpu servers.
.SS \fL*nomce=\fIvalue\fP
If machine check exceptions are supported by the processor,
then they are enabled by default.
Setting this variable to
.B 1
causes them to be disabled even when available.
.SS \fL*nomp=\fP
A multiprocessor machine will enable all processors by default.
Setting
.B *nomp
restricts the kernel to starting only one processor and using the
traditional interrupt controller.
.SS \fL*ncpu=\fIvalue\fP
Setting
.B *ncpu
restricts the kernel to starting at most
.I value
processors.
.SS \fL*apicdebug=\fP
Prints a summary of the multiprocessor APIC interrupt configuration.
.SS \fL*nomsi=\fP
Disables message signaled interrupts.
.SS \fL*notsc=\fP
Disables the use of the per processor timestamp counter registers
as high resolution clock.
.SS \fL*pcimaxbno=value\fP
This puts a limit on the maximum bus number probed
on a PCI bus (default 7).
For example, a
.I value
of 1 should suffice on a 'standard' motherboard with an AGP slot.
This, and
.B *pcimaxdno
below are rarely used and only on troublesome or suspect hardware.
.SS \fL*pcimaxdno=\fIvalue\fP
This puts a limit on the maximum device number probed
on a PCI bus (default 31).
.SS \fL*nopcirouting=\fP
Disable pci routing during boot.  May solve interrupt routing
problems on certain machines.
.SS \fL*pcihinv=\fP
Prints a summary of the detected PCI busses and devices.
.SS \fL*nodumpstack=\fP
Disable printing a stack dump on panic.
Useful if there is only a limited cga screen available,
otherwise the textual information about the panic may scroll off.
.\" .SS \fL*nobios=\fP
.\" what does this do?  something with pci
.SS \fLioexclude=\fIvalue\fP
Specifies a list of ranges of I/O ports to exclude from use by drivers.
Ranges are inclusive on both ends and separated by commas.
For example:
.EX
    ioexclude=0x330-0x337,0x430-0x43F
.EE
.SS \fLumbexclude=\fIvalue\fP
Specifies a list of ranges of UMB to exclude from use by drivers.
Ranges are inclusive on both ends and separated by commas.
For example:
.EX
    umbexclude=0xD1800-0xD3FFF
.EE
.SS \fL*acpi=\fIvalue\fP
The presence of this option enables ACPI and the export of the
.B #P/acpitbls
file in
.IR arch (3)
device. In multiprocessor mode, the kernel will use the ACPI
tables to configure APIC interrupts unless a
.I value
of
.B 0
is specified.
.SS \fLapm0=\fP
This enables the ``advanced power management'' interface
as described in
.IR apm (3)
and
.IR apm (8).
The main feature of the interface is the ability to watch
battery life (see
.IR stats (8)).
It is not on by default because it causes problems on some laptops.
.SS \fLnousbhname=\fP
When defined,
.IR nusbrc (8)
will use the dynamically assigned usb device address to name
usb devices instead of the device unique name.
.SS VIDEO
.SS \fLmonitor=\fIvalue\fP
.SS \fLvgasize=\fIvalue\fP
These are used not by the kernel but by
.I termrc
(see
.IR cpurc (8))
when starting
.IR vga (8).
If
.I value
is set to
.B ask
then the user is prompted for a choice on boot.
.SS \fL*bootscreen=\fIvalue\fP
This is used by the kernel to attach a pre-initialized
linear framebuffer that was setup by the bootloader
or firmware.
The
.I value
has four space separated fields: the resolution and bitdepth
of the screen, the color channel descriptor, the physical
address of the framebuffer and a optional aperture size.
.EX
	*bootscreen=800x600x32 x8r8g8b8 0x80000000 0x001d4c00
.EE
.SS \fL*dpms=\fIvalue\fP
This is used to specify the screen blanking behavior of the MGA4xx
video driver.
Values are
.BR standby ,
.BR suspend ,
and
.BR off .
The first two specify differing levels of power saving;
the third turns the monitor off completely.
.SS NVRAM
.SS \fLnvram=\fIfile\fP
.SS \fLnvrlen=\fIlength\fP
.SS \fLnvroff=\fIoffset\fP
This is used to specify an nvram device and optionally the length of the ram
and read/write offset to use.
These values are consulted by
.I readnvram
(see
.IR authsrv (2)).
The most common use of the nvram is to hold a
.IR secstore (1)
password for use by
.IR factotum (4).
.SS \fLnvr=\fIvalue\fP
This is used by the WORM file server kernel to locate a file holding information
to configure the file system.
The file cannot live on a SCSI disk.
The default is
.B fd!0!plan9.nvr
(sic),
unless
.B bootfile
is set, in which case it is
.B plan9.nvr
on the same disk as
.BR bootfile .
The syntax is either
.BI fd! unit ! name
or
.BI hd! unit ! name
where
.I unit
is the numeric unit id.
This variant syntax is a vestige of the file server kernel's origins.
