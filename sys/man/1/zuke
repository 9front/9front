.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Zuke
is a graphical music player that reads a playlist from standard input
and presents an interface to play music.
.PP
Playlists are generated by
.IR mkplist ,
which accepts files, directories, and URLs as its arguments,
and writes the resulting playlist to standard output. Option
.B -s
enables "simple" sorting of the entries of the playlist, where only
full paths are compared.
.PP
Formats supported by
.I zuke
are: MP3, OGG/Vorbis, FLAC, and WAV.  With additional programs, Opus,
modules and M4A (AAC) can be played.
.I Zuke
also supports network streams, such as IceCast.
Option
.B -s
enables ``shuffle'' mode on start.
.PP
The columns (and their order) displayed can be changed by passing the
following letters along

corresponds to

.PP
.I Zuke
can be controlled with a mouse, keyboard, and plumber.  Button 1
selects a track, button 2 plays a track.  Clicking on the seek bar
changes the playback position accordingly.  On the right of the seek
bar, current position, track duration and volume are displayed.  ``∫''
is shown if shuffle mode is enabled.

Plumbing a file with
.B .plist
extension loads the playlist in

.PD
.PP
Typing any digit initiates a "Seek to" prompt. Minutes, hours and
seconds can be separated with a colon, if needed, otherwise the
position is taken as seconds from the beginning of the track.
.PP
.I Zuke
can be controlled by emulating key presses via the plumber port
.IR audio .
.PP
Files present in the current playlist can be plumbed too, and will be
played immediately.
.PP
When a new track starts playing,
.I zuke
will write its tags to
.BR stdout ,
each column separated by a tab character.  If playback is stopped, an
empty line is written instead.  This can be used for scrobbling or
displaying the current track in another window.
.PP
.I Readtags
prints tags stored within audio files. When option
.B -i
is specified, it will try to extract the cover image and write it to
standard output as a Plan 9 image instead.
