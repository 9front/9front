.SH NAME
stream \- fast sequential file access
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I stream
device serves a one-level directory containing files of the form
.IR N stream
where
.I N
is a file descriptor of the current process.
.PP
An
.IR open (2)
returns a stream file descriptor connected to the original file
refered to by the file descriptor
.IR N .
When a stream was opend for reading, the device will start
continuously reading the file in the background until it reaches
the end of the file. A
.IR read (2)
on the stream consumes the prefetched data in sequential order.
.PP
When a stream is opend for writing, writes to the stream will
return immidiately without waiting for the data to be written
to the file. A zero-length write can be used to wait for the
buffered data to drain and return any previous write errors.
