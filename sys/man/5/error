is used to return an error string
describing the
failure of a transaction.
It replaces the corresponding reply message
that would accompany a successful call; its tag is that
of the failing request.
.PP
Any error string may be returned, but by convention, there
should be a prefix that describes the error in a way that
may be checked by a machine, followed by any additional
useful information.
.PP
There are a handful of common error prefixes that are used:
.TP
.B interrupted
The operation that was in progress was cancelled before it
could be completed.
.TP
.B file not found
A walk was not able to match the requested name
.TP
.B i/o on hungup channel
The channel that was being used was closed
.PP
By convention, clients may truncate error messages after
.B ERRMAX-1
bytes;
.B ERRMAX
is defined in
.BR <libc.h> .
