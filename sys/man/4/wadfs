.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wadfs
serves a file tree mounted at
.I mtpt
(default
.BR /mnt/wad )
that provides access to a
.I WAD
file's contents.
.PP
The command line options are:
.TF "-S srvname"
.TP
.B -D
Enable 9P debugging messages.
.TP
.B -r
Set read-only file tree.
.TP
.BI -S \ srvname
Post channel on
.RI /srv/ srvname .
.TP
.BI -m \ mtpt
Set mountpoint.
.PD
.PP
A
.I WAD
is a concatenation of uncompressed files, referred to as lumps.
A lump may contain either data,
or be used as a marker to indicate the beginning or end of a section,
segregating lumps of the same format.
.PP
.I Wadfs
represents section start markers as directories,
and regular lumps and end markers as files.
For convenience, lump file names are in lower case,
and are translated to the upper case internally.
.PP
At startup, if the path to a
.I WAD
file is provided as argument,
.I wadfs
will attempt to parse it and construct a file tree.
Otherwise,
.I wadfs
starts with a blank tree instead.
.PP
Two additional files are provided in the file system's root directory:
.L SIG
and
.LR WAD .
Reading from and writing to
.L SIG
allows accessing and changing the
.IR WAD 's
type.
The only possible values are
.L PWAD
(the default) and
.LR IWAD .
.PP
.L WAD
returns the new
.I WAD
file resulting from the recompilation of the lump tree.
.SS "WAD file structure"
There are few restrictions on the structure of
.I WAD
files.
Excepting maps, sections can nest and may have no end marker,
or one named differently than the section itself.
Regular sections typically have one-letter names,
and nested sections use the same name appended by a digit.
By convention,
lump names may only contain visible printing
.SM ASCII
characters,
excepting lower-case letters.
Map sections do not end at a marker but at the next non map lump,
and use hardcoded names, depending on game version.
.PP
.I Wadfs
imposes a number of additional restrictions on structure and naming:
.IP • 3
Lump names may not contain upper-case letters and the
.L /
character.
.IP •
A map section may only contain map lumps, which use hardcoded names.
Ordering is significant, but is handled automatically.
Map sections may not nest.
.IP •
Regular sections may not nest beyond one level,
and may not contain more than one end marker.
End markers may not exist outside of a section.
Directory names omit the start marker's
.L "_START"
suffix.
.IP •
Excepting map lumps, no two lumps, including markers,
may have the same name.
.IP •
Once created, a lump may not be renamed so as to change its type.
.SS "Error recovery"
Upon parsing the initial
.I WAD
file, if one of the restrictions for
.I WAD
file structure outlined in the sections above is not respected,
a warning is issued, and the offending lump is potentially skipped.
Some recovery is attempted,
but one must systematically recheck the tree.
When duplicate non marker lumps are encountered,
each will overwrite the previous entry.
.SH EXAMPLES
Open
.B doom2.wad
and play a MUS file:
.IP
.EX
% games/wadfs /sys/games/lib/doom/doom2.wad
createfile SW18_7: file already exists
% games/mus /mnt/wad/d_romero | games/midi
.EE
.PP
Now create a blank
.IR WAD ,
then one section
.LR FF ;
copy a flat from
.B doom2.wad
to the directory,
then rename the end marker to
.L F_END
to have the
.B doom
engine find the flat;
finally, compile and save the new
.I WAD
file.
.IP
.EX
% games/wadfs -m /mnt/wad2
% cd /mnt/wad2
% mkdir ff
adding end marker FF_END
% cp ../wad/f/f1/f_sky1 ff/
% mv ff/ff_end ff/f_end
% cp WAD /sys/games/lib/doom/sky.wad

.SH HISTORY
.I Wadfs
first appeared in 9front (August, 2017).
.SH BUGS
Many
.I WAD
files in the wild do not conform to all the rules exposed above,
in particular ones using
.SM DeHackEd
engine modifications.
.IR WAD 's
using end markers outside of a section,
typically 
.LR F_END ,
will lose them.
.PP
Repairing broken
.I WAD
files can be a pain.
