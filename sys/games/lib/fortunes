There is only one H atom between any given pair of O atoms.  Ice Rule
Each O atom has two H atoms close to it and the unit of the water molecule is preserved.  Ice Rule
For any type of thing, there are more small things in the world than large things.  Benford's Rule
Carcinogenicity in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is associated with the presence of a bay region.  Bay Rule

Imagine a giant cock flying towards your mouth, and there's nothing you can do about it.  And you're like "Oh man, I'm gonna have to suck this thing", and you brace yourself to suck this giant cock.  But then, at the last moment, it changes trajectory and hits you in the eye.  You think to yourself "Well, at least I got that out of the way", but then the giant cock rears back and stabs your eye again, and again, and again.  Eventually, this giant cock is penetrating your gray matter, and you begin to lose control of your motor skills.  That's when the giant cock slaps you across the cheek, causing you to fall out of your chair.  Unable to move and at your most vulnerable, the giant cock finally lodges itself in your anus, where it rests uncomfortably for 4 maybe 5 hours.  That's what using a Mac OS X is like.  -- anonymous

Soon Unix had the mass of Andre the Giant, the body of the Elephant Man, and the mind of a forgotten Jack Nicholson character.
The worst strain was on Unix's mind.  Unable to assimilate all the conflicting patchworks of features it had ingested, its personality began to fragment into millions of distinct, incompatible operating systems.  People would cautiously say "good morning Unix.  And who are we today?" and it would reply "Beastie" (BSD), or "Domain", or "I'm System III, but I'll be System V tomorrow." Psychiatrists labored for years to weld together the two major poles of Unix's personality, "Beasty Boy", an inner-city youth from Berkeley, and "Belle", a southern transvestite who wanted a to be a woman.  With each attempt, the two poles would mutate, like psychotic retroviruses, leaving their union a worthless blob of protoplasm requiring constant life support to remain compatible with its parent personalities.
Finally, unbalanced by its own cancerous growth, Unix fell into a vat of toxic radioactive wombat urine, from which it emerged, skin white and hair green.  It smelled like somebody's dead grandmother.
