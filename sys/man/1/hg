undo an add before that, see hg revert.

.RE
.RE

addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...
.RS 4
Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in .hgignore. As
with add, these changes take effect at the next commit.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Use the \-s option to detect renamed files.  With a parameter > 0,
this compares every removed file with every added file and records
those similar enough as renames.  This option takes a percentage
between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must be identical) as its
parameter.  Detecting renamed files this way can be expensive.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
options:
\-s, \-\-similarity  guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)
\-I, \-\-include     include names matching the given patterns

annotate [\-r REV] [\-f] [\-a] [\-u] [\-d] [\-n] [\-c] [\-l] FILE...
.RS 4
List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for each line
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
This command is useful to discover who did a change or when a change took
place.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4

Without the \-a option, annotate will avoid processing files it
detects as binary. With \-a, annotate will generate an annotation
anyway, probably with undesirable results.

archive [OPTION]... DEST
.RS 4
By default, the revision used is the parent of the working directory; use "\-r" to specify a different revision.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
To specify the type of archive to create, use "\-t".  Valid
types are:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
"files" (default): a directory full of files
"tar": tar archive, uncompressed
"tbz2": tar archive, compressed using bzip2
"tgz": tar archive, compressed using gzip
"uzip": zip archive, uncompressed
"zip": zip archive, compressed using deflate
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
using a format string; see "hg help export" for details.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
prepended.  Use "\-p" to specify a format string for the prefix.
The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes removed.
.fi

options:
\-\-no\-decode    do not pass files through decoders
\-p, \-\-prefix   directory prefix for files in archive
\-r, \-\-rev      revision to distribute

\-X, \-\-exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

.RE

.PP
backout [OPTION]... [\-r] REV
.RS 4
Commit the backed out changes as a new changeset. The new changeset is a child of the backed out changeset.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
If you back out a changeset other than the tip, a new head is
created.  This head will be the new tip and you should merge this
backout changeset with another head (current one by default).
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
The \-\-merge option remembers the parent of the working directory
before starting the backout, then merges the new head with that
changeset afterwards.  This saves you from doing the merge by
hand.  The result of this merge is not committed, as for a normal
merge.

bisect [\-gbsr] [REV]
.RS 4
This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision for testing. Once you have performed tests, mark the working directory as bad or good and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset or announce that it has found the bad revision.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
options:
\-r, \-\-reset     reset bisect state
\-g, \-\-good      mark changeset good

.RS 4
With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument, set the working directory branch name (the branch does not exist in the repository until the next commit).

Unless \-\-force is specified, branch will not let you set a
branch name that shadows an existing branch.

bundle [\-f] [\-a] [\-r REV]... [\-\-base REV]... FILE [DEST]
.RS 4
Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not found in the other repository.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
If no destination repository is specified the destination is
assumed to have all the nodes specified by one or more \-\-base
parameters.  To create a bundle containing all changesets, use
\-\-all (or \-\-base null).
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4

The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means and
applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull command.
This is useful when direct push and pull are not available or when
exporting an entire repository is undesirable.

clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source.
.fi

For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the source
and destination are on the same filesystem (note this applies only
to the repository data, not to the checked out files).  Some
filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking incorrectly, but
do not report errors.  In these cases, use the \-\-pull option to
avoid hardlinking.

atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during the operation is
up to you) and you have to make sure your editor breaks hardlinks

Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
\- SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
  and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
\- path is relative to the remote user\'s home directory by default.
  Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
    ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
\- Mercurial doesn\'t use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
  to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:
    Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
      Compression no
    Host *
      Compression yes
  Alternatively specify "ssh \-C" as your ssh command in your hgrc or

.RE
.sp

The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END
are revision identifiers.  Both BEGIN and END are optional.  If
BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to revision number 0.  If END
is not specified, it defaults to the tip.  The range ":" thus
means "all revisions".
