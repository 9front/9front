\section{Introduction}
The \module{email} package provides classes and utilities to create,
parse, generate, and modify email messages, conforming to all the
relevant email and MIME related RFCs.

This document describes version 4.0 of the \module{email} package, which is
distributed with Python 2.5 and is available as a standalone distutils-based
package for use with earlier Python versions.  \module{email} 4.0 is not
compatible with Python versions earlier than 2.3.  For more information about
the \module{email} package, including download links and mailing lists, see
\ulink{Python's email SIG}{http://www.python.org/sigs/email-sig}.

The documentation that follows was written for the Python project, so
if you're reading this as part of the standalone \module{email}
package documentation, there are a few notes to be aware of:

\begin{itemize}
\item Deprecation and ``version added'' notes are relative to the
      Python version a feature was added or deprecated.  See
      the package history in section \ref{email-pkg-history} for details.

\item If you're reading this documentation as part of the
      standalone \module{email} package, some of the internal links to
      other sections of the Python standard library may not resolve.

\end{itemize}
