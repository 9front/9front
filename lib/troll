Why should I boot Plan 9, when I know I can't run a browser, and I already have p9p?
The (9P) protocol has also other glaring mis-features -- it lacks the ability of moving files -- if you want to move a big file on a remote machine from one directory to another, you'll have to copy it back and forth, all the way. This is incredibly dumb.
I doubt plan9 will ever get into a usable system. Everything inside is like high-brow silliness, second-system syndrome and stupid vulnerabilities you only meet with in historic code from 30 years ago.
As to the ideas inspired by plan9 in modern unix systems, they quickly became just encumbering legacy crap -- e.g. the /proc system in linux.

NIX 64-bit kernel is available
Out of curiosity: 9front makes high claims about device drivers, are these compatible with Plan 9 (and NIX)?  If so, is there a list?
nix has been dealing with problems due to osx : mangling.
For those using 9vx on OSX: it's really easy to set up your local drive to support a case sensitive file system.  Just don't make it the root partition or where /Users resides in case you run any applications out of ~/Applications that come from certain large corporations (aka any that really pushed the Carbon APIs, or applications that originated in Carbon but were only slowly migrated to Cocoa).  You can create a case-sensitive disk image, though that has some drawbacks.  Partition your drive and then add an entry into /etc/fstab so that it always mounts at a logical place, and not some /Volumes with a potentially variable name.
I bet you're a ranting Friedmanite like the rest of the 9front faggots.

Hi, I'm using golang to code a 9p filesystem on linux.
In spite of some really great ideas, I think we'd all agree that Plan-9 has no real future.
I now have 9Front running fine, and, in fact, I am renewing a port of an OO language extension to it.
prevailing wisdom seems to say to go with 9atom unless you need the hardware support of 9front - please correct me if this is wrong.
If you want your work to be useful to the Plan 9 community (and I hope you do), please stay with us and improve the real Plan 9.
