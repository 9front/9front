.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mothra
retrieves and displays files from the World-Wide Web,
by name or through hypertext links.
Web names, called URLs, have a peculiar syntax:
.IP
.EX
http://netlib.att.com/netlib/1127/www/1127.html
http://akebono.stanford.edu:80/yahoo/
http://www.teleport.com/~crowell/
ftp://ftp.gmd.de/music/scores/harrington/Harrington.readme
.EE
.PP
The part up to the first colon gives the protocol for
retrieving the file.
.BR http: ,
Hyper-Text Transfer
Protocol, is the usual way of accessing web files.
.B ftp:
and
.B gopher:
are standard Internet services.
.PD
.PP
.B //
begins the Internet address of the server where the file resides.
The address may contain a colon and a TCP port
number, which overrides the 
default port number for the service.  Next comes a
file name.  Finally, the file name may be followed by
.B #
and a string giving a label within the file where the
display should begin.
.PP
.I Mothra
starts with the
.I url
given on the command line, defaulting to
the environment variable
.BR $url .

.TP
.B  -d

Mothra uses
.IR webfs (4)
to retrive the URL data. The mountpoint, default is

can be changed with the

.I mtpt .

a scrollable list of previously visited files,
the title and URL of the current file,
and the scrollable text of the current file.
