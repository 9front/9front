\chapter{Data Persistence}
\label{persistence}

The modules described in this chapter support storing Python data in a
persistent form on disk.  The \module{pickle} and \module{marshal}
modules can turn many Python data types into a stream of bytes and
then recreate the objects from the bytes.  The various DBM-related
modules support a family of hash-based file formats that store a
mapping of strings to other strings.  The \module{bsddb} module also
provides such disk-based string-to-string mappings based on hashing,
and also supports B-Tree and record-based formats.

The list of modules described in this chapter is:
