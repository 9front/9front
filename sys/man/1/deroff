.TH DEROFF 1 
.SH NAME
deroff \- remove formatting requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B deroff
[
.I option ...
]
.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Deroff
reads each file in sequence
and removes all
.I nroff
and
.IR troff (1)
requests and non-text arguments, backslash constructions,
and constructs of preprocessors such as
.IR eqn (1),
.IR pic (1),
and
.IR tbl (1).
Remaining text is written on the standard output.
.I Deroff
follows files included by
.L .so
and
.L .nx
commands;
if a file has already been included, a
.L .so
for that file is ignored and a
.L .nx
terminates execution.
If no input file is given,
.I deroff
reads from standard input.
.PP
The options are
.TP
.B -w
Output a word list, one `word' (string of letters, digits, and
properly embedded ampersands and apostrophes,
beginning with a letter) per line.
Other characters are skipped.
Otherwise, the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.
.TP
.B -_
Like
.BR -w ,
but consider underscores to be alphanumeric rather than punctuation.
.TP
.B -i
Ignore
.L .so
and
.L .nx
requests.
.TP
.BR -ms
.PD0
.TP
.B -mm
Remove titles, attachments, etc., as well as ordinary 
.IR troff
constructs, from
.IR ms (6)
or
.I mm
documents.
.PD
.TP
.B -ml
Same as
.BR -mm ,
but remove lists as well.

.SH BUGS
This filter is not a complete interpreter of
.I troff .
For example, macro definitions containing
.L \e$
cause chaos in
.IR deroff
when the popular
.L $$
delimiters for
.I eqn
are in effect. 
.PP
Text inside macros is emitted at place of
definition, not place of call.
