.SH DESCRIPTION
Mercurial is a distributed version control system. It tracks
and organizes files and keeps a change history of them. The
file revisions are stored as packed deltas in a repository
that can be checked out with the
.IR hg (1)
program.

.I Hgfs
allows read-only access to all stored file revisions
in a repository as simple files.

Starting
.I hgfs
without any options locates the repository of
the current working directory and mounts itself on
.B /n/hg.

The resulting served directory contains a list of subdirectories,
each corresponding to a specific changeset revision.

The special
name
.B tip
corresponds to the latest changeset but is not listed.

In each revision directory the following files can be found:
.TP
.B rev1
contains the parent revision id as text.
.TP
.B rev2
If the changeset was a merge, contains the other parent revision id. Otherwise, a zero size file.
.TP
.B log
The
.B log
file contains a list of file names, separated by a newline, that where
touched in this changeset. Files that are listed in the log
but are not visible in
.B files
or
.B changes
where deleted in this changeset.
.TP
.B who
committer of the changeset.
.TP
.B why
commit message of the changeset.
.TP
.B files
A directory that contains a snapshot of the filetree when this change was made.
To retrieve the \fIn\fRth
past version of a file, append
.I .n
to the filename. For revision id
.I revn,
append
.I .revn.
.TP
.B changes
Same as
.B files,
but contains only the changed files.
