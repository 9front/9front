.TH GALAXY 6
.SH NAME
galaxy \- representations of n-body simulations
.SH DESCRIPTION
Files of this format are interpreted by
.IR galaxy (1)
as describing the inital condition of n-body simulations
or the saved state of simulation in progress.
A galaxy file is a UTF stream of instruction lines. The
instruction is given by the first space delimited word. The
following instructions are accepted.
.TP
.B MKBODY
The rest of the line must contain 5 white space delimited
double-precision floating point numbers. They represent a
body's x coordinate, y coordinate, x velocity component,
y velocity component, and size respectively.
.TP
.B ORIG
The rest of the line must contain 2 white space delimited
double-precision floating point numbers. They represent
the current location of the origin with respect to the
view window of
.IR galaxy (1).
.TP
.B DT
The rest of the line must contain a double-precision
floating point number which determines the time-scale
of the simulation.
.TP
.B SCALE
The rest of the line must contain a double-precision
floating point number which determines the scale
of the view of the simulation.
.TP
.B GRAV
The rest of the line must contain a double-precision
floating point number which determines the gravitational
constant of the simulation.
