.TH SMART 8
.SH NAME
disk/smart \- SMART error monitoring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disk/smart
[
.B -aptv
]
.IR drive ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B disk/smart
command uses the
.IR sd (3)
raw interface for continuous disk health logging to
.B /sys/log/smart
and, with the
.B -v
flag, the console for ATA and SCSI disks supporting
SMART-style reporting.  The
.B -t flag causes
.B disk/smart
to exit after a single probe and implies
.BR -v .
With the
.B -p
flag or no arguments,
.B disk/smart
probes for all SMART-capable drives.  With
.B -a
SMART-capable drives are announced.  Logging
behaves as if level triggered.  If a smart
condition is set it will be logged every 6 hours.
Condition reset also resets the log timer.
