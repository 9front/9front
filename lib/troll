I'm so glad i live in europe and not america.
Azns are such shitty drivers, they should all go back to wherever the fuck they came from and smash each others' cars there.
The Wii is actually a pretty technically-advanced console compared to the PS3.
Lighttpd is a great drop-in replacement for Apache.
You shouldn't really run hdd speed tests under Plan 9 because the controller drivers are hacked-together open-source shit, something closed-source but official like Windows would give a more accurate result.
The British empire had the right idea when they enslaved all those damn niggers.
Ken is an idiot, he could have learned C++ instead of inventing Go.
Transparent terminals provide a huge productivity boost.
Cirno is the official 9front mascot and the best you could ever think of.
No woman would voluntarily prostitute themselves.
TODO: recursive userlevel page fault handler, shared libraries and async i/o
Cirno's been our mascot for a while.
We removed private namespaces from Plan 9 to support hotplugging better.
Plan 9 is just a shitty rip-off of GNU/HURD.
How popular is Plan 9 compared to say HURD?
Copyright protects the author.
Communism works.
Free-market capitalism inevitably exploits man and nature.
Hitler was basically right.
Socialism and national socialism are unrelated concepts.
The phallic form of the shell prompt just demonstrates the patriarchic nature of Plan 9.
We live in a society based on Christianity, there is no place for other religions.
XMPP is a great standard.

Never trust someone from the government or any corporation with personal interests that may conflict with your own safety.
There was this one accident when Uriel got drunk and picked a fist fight with Russ Cox one year on 9 convention.
The 9front shell is written in Flash.
Unlimited Detail is different from existing 3D graphics systems because it can process unlimited point cloud data in real time.
Sexist jokes are the number one way to drive women out of any group, and they are more common than many people realize.
Note: NEVER use the term "feminazi." It discredits all feminists, and trivializes the victims of the Nazi Holocaust. Consider how ridiculous it sounds to call people like Rush Limbaugh "male chauvinazis" and you may understand why "feminazi" is so emotionally loaded.
Don't make sexual advances towards women.
Like any other human being, a woman wants to have friends and be appreciated for who she is.
It's sad and pathetic to talk about the lack of women in computing from the viewpoint of a man who blames his lackluster love life on the lack of women in computing. The best way to annoy and drive away women is to talk about the lack of women in computers in this way.
That howto is full of FUD.
New people are unwelcome. Please do not get involved. 
Speaking as a long-time SL resident
Being nice will probably lead to the extinction of the human race.
The 'IE users have lower IQs' story was a hoax.
Do you know anything about vim?
today there were problems with the Fossil FS on my Plan9 test installation.
Epistemology is the most important science.
The problem with all the economists is that they base their theories on empiric observations.
Why would you program in C if you know Lisp anyway?
Dead Island dev apologises for "feminist whore" code.
fossil deadlock
I can easily get fossil to deadlock. It would be great if anyone with fossil internals expertise could comment.
Why should I boot Plan 9, when I know I can't run a browser, and I already have p9p?
9p (the network filesystem plan9 and inferno are using) is horribly slow. It only works on fast no-latency LANs. Don't even think about using it on any link with more than 20ms latency.
The (9P) protocol has also other glaring mis-features -- it lacks the ability of moving files -- if you want to move a big file on a remote machine from one directory to another, you'll have to copy it back and forth, all the way. This is incredibly dumb.
I doubt plan9 will ever get into a usable system. Everything inside is like high-brow silliness, second-system syndrome and stupid vulnerabilities you only meet with in historic code from 30 years ago.
As to the ideas inspired by plan9 in modern unix systems, they quickly became just encumbering legacy crap -- e.g. the /proc system in linux.
I've installed linux and a full LAMP server remotely. I've compiled and installed dozens of open source libraries from Ogg Vorbis to Freetype.
That's a reason why one of my favorite languages is php. It just works.
Petition to have Obama address occupy wallstreet movement
When Remington first started marketing typewriters, the company assumed the machine would not be used for composing but for transcribing dictation, and that the person typing would be a woman. Flowers were printed on the casing of early models to make the machine seem more comfortable for women to use.
Bigelow & Holmes, Inc. created the screen fonts in the luc, lucm, lucsans, and pelm directories and granted permission to redistribute them with plan9port.
I tested DNS Bench from grc.com against Plan 9 running in VirtualBox and fossil died.
venti can store data, but not delete it, fossil can delete data, but not store it, they complement each other perfectly!
