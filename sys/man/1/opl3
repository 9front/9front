.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opl3
[
.B -n
.I rate
] [
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Opl3
is an emulator of a single Yamaha 262 chip, also known as
.SM OPL3.
.PP
The emulated chip is programmed by a stream of commands either from
.I file
or from standard in.
It then synthesizes a number of stereo 16 bit little-endian samples for a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz,
and writes them to standard out.
.PP
Commands are 5 bytes wide, in little-endian byte order:
.PP
.RS
.IR register [2]
.IR value [1]
.IR delay [2]
.RE
.PP
Each command specifies a
.I value
to be written to an
.SM OPL3
chip
.IR register ,
modifying its internal state.
.PP
The
.I delay
field provides timing.
It is a multiple of a command period, during which the
.SM OPL3
chip may be sampled before processing the next command.
The period itself is the inverse of the command rate, 44100 Hz by default.
This rate can be set using the
.B -n
parameter.
