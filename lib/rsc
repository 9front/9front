This has always annoyed me.
If you tell me what the code should be I'll fix it.
I don't really understand what the problem is.
It was a failure of vision.
My apologies.
If you want to build your own, you've got all the pieces. :)
It's your call.
enjoy.
Yes, with a caveat.
No.
What were you doing when it crashed?
IBM wasn't thinking much about the future when they set up the VGA registers.
Thanks for the fix.
vga is a very hard problem.
I don't agree about the x86.
Hmm.  Not exactly what I had in mind.
We haven't been making the common distinction between stable and "unstable" versions of the software.
Put things in the right place to begin with.
in my mind wheel mice don't count.
i've been hoarding real three-button mice for a while now; the end is near.
I wrote a simple client long ago that I could dig up.
please, do us all a favor and write a better one.
i've tried mothra and charon, and neither satisfies me.
That's fine for now.
Have fun.
eww.
This is getting more off topic by the day.
It is possible to write very clear code that really doesn't need comments nor "literate" interpretation.
it looks like an error from hotmail, not from plan 9.
we're stuck with ssh, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking it's a good protocol.
Aha.
I might not understand the question.
Sorry about not being more specific.
Actually that's the way it's supposed to work.
that was me.
if you're going to do something about it, great.
I think.
Some extra work is required.
that's a bigger job than you might think.
We can fix the code, probably.
This is misleading.
it took me just as long to install the windows software as it did to write the plan 9 software.
All things being equal, maybe I'd like there to be more Plan 9 users.
Sorry, I don't think there's much we can do.
The bikeshed has already been painted, and the painter has gone.
Being stuck using Solaris makes being stuck using Linux look like a birthday party.
also, plan9front claims to include a working go compiler. what did they do?
I don't think we'd scale to a thousand nodes very well.
Buh?
Feature lists are great, but don't forget that there's always an implementation cost.
Sorry, no luck.
Now, now, be fair.
I wish...
We tried that.
Dude, wake up!
Looks like a bug to me.
You think Windows runs in polynomial time?
Also, backups are good.
if you want something in particular, you could always port it.
Suppose you subscribe to the Kernighan & Plauger thesis that programs should be clear.
NOT LGTM
Even if we'd made a horrible mistake, though, we cannot change it now as that would break the compatibility promise we have made with Go 1.
Your source is mistaken.
This sounds like an intriguing and fun way to structure a program.
Chording works too: or example, copy is hold down mouse button, highlight, type option, type command, let go of mouse button.
Very nice.
looks fine.
Thanks, but I'd prefer not to do this.
Interesting, thanks.
Ouch
Please don't.
Test?
sure
NOT LGTM sorry
i lost the ability to use rio a few years ago when they moved wireless configuration into the gnome window manager, making it impossible to have rio and a network connection at the same time.
I think we all just use Chrome or Firefox or whatever.
I think we're done here.
I think you have to drag it into the Applications folder.
