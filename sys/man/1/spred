.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spred
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Spred
is an editor for small images using a limited palette.
It uses a window system mimicking
.IR sam (1).
There is a command window which uses a command language described below.
There is also an arbitrary number of palette and sprite windows.
Each open sprite file has an associated palette file.
.PP
A left click on a color in a palette window selects that color.
Colors in different palettes can be selected indepedently.
A left click on a pixel in a sprite window sets that pixel to the selected color.
.PP
A right click brings up the global menu to create windows etc.
It also lists all currently open files, including those that are not open in any window.
A middle click brings up the menu for the local window, if applicable. Available commands there are:
.TP
.I pal
The \fIpal\fR command sets the palette for the current sprite window. The palette is selected with a middle click.
.PP
The command language is a very stripped down version of
.IR rc (1),
currently only supporting "simple" commands consisting of a name and an arbitrary number of arguments separated by spaces. Quoting works just like with
.IR rc (1).
Available commands are:
.TP
.B q
Quits the program. If any files have unsaved changes, it will fail on the first attempt to quit.
.TP
.BI pal " file
.TP
.BI spr " file

.TP
.BI size " sz
Sets the size of the current file to \fIsz\fR.
\fISz\fR should be of the form \fIn\fR for palettes or \fIn\fB*\fIm\fR for sprites where \fIn\fR and \fIm\fR are integers.
.TP
.B set 0x\fIrrggbb\fR
Sets the currently selected color to the rgb color \fI(rr,gg,bb)\fR where
\fIrr, gg\fR and \fIbb\fR are in hexadecimal notation.
